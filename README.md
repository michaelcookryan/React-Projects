This was a final project in my first class in React.

There are three projects availabl to view here:

1. Rock Paper Scissors Game - the first one to 5 wins.
2. To-Do - add items to a list, then check them off to remove them as they are completed.
3. Weather App - Find the current conditions and 10 day outlook for 5 Canadian cities
